How to download and use DiscoBSD instead of RETROBSD with Olimex PIC32-RETROBSD

1. If you want to program the hex via USB: Download pic32prog build for Ubuntu 22.04 from this fork: https://github.com/jblang/pic32prog/releases/tag/ubuntu-fix (Windows users, see instructions for using USB device from WSL2 using usbipd: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)
2. Download latest release with DiscoBSD PIC32 archive from: https://github.com/chettrick/discobsd/releases
3. Run `pic32prog unix.hex` with the unix.hex file from the pinguino-micro directory extracted from the zip.
4. Prepare the micro SD card with sdcard.img

If you have a PIC32 compatible programmer attach it to the 6-pin ICSP header and program with the unix.hex from step 2 (skip steps 1 and 3).

It is best to use latest versions of the software from the links, but in case they are not working you can find versions we used at our GitHub.
